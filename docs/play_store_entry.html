                            <p>Anytime you can add an expense or income into the app very simply. There are quite a lot income and 
                                expense categories which covers most common aspects of our life. Also with a lot of Payment categories you can define 
                                payment type in each entry. The Home screen is there to display your monthy balance,
                                warnings based on the expense threshold you have set and your last three entries.
                            </p>

                            to sort the entries. For Filtering a starting date and ending date can be entered, you can also give your preferred category and payment type
                            at the same time to Filter the entries.

                    <p>You have an expense or income that is repeated in every month? Then our recurring entry option is here to make your app experience more
                        smoother. From this menu you can add your recurring income or expense, set the starting or ending date for it and ofcourse you can set the interval 
                        period for this recurring entry. 
                        </p>

                <p>Sometimes we are unaware or unconsious about an expense of a specific category and we exaust the limit we had thought in our mind. To get control over
                    this problem we have introduced the option to set multiple warnings where you can set the upper and lower threshold value for getting warnings for a 
                    specific expense category. The home screen will update automatically and display you a warning message when the upper threshold is nearly or fully exausted.
                    When the expense is too low for the specific category based on the lower threshold it will also display a warning message at the home screen.

            </u></b>
            <p>For privacy concerns we have integrated the Security settings so while starting the app for the first time the user will be asked to
                set up his Username and Password. If you skip at the first time you can later set this from the security menu. After the usernsame & password has been successfully set up
                every time the user exits the app he will be asked to enter his username & password to enter the app. Security and privacy of the
                app has always been a major concern for us.
