                    <p>Welcome to the blog of team <b>The Clever Swabian</b>! We are
                        excited to show you the final stages of our project. We developed our first Android
                        application. On this page, we are going to inform you about technical challenges that all of us
                        encountered during work ,
                        benefits the team experienced
                        and how the ISEE course met our needs.

                            <p><strong>Lack of experience regarding Android developlemt</strong><br>The team members of
                                The clever Swabian hardly had any beforehand experience with Android or application development in general.
                                Two of us are from the mechanical engineering,
                                one from electrical engineering and one from CSE (he doesn't have that much experience in
                                Android) which led to some problems. Most of us tried to fill up this knowledge gap and all of us
                                gathered a lot of knowledge about Java and Android Studio.
                                In the very end we can say that we all as a team have always tried to give the best of it.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Unavailability of proper documentation</strong> <br />
                                There are numerous tutorials/documentations for Android Studio available, however these
                                are often outdated due to the rapid further development of Android. After getting any
                                documentation we had to go through heavy research to make it compatible to our app and
                                that happened in almost every case.
                                This didn’t help to make development easier.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Android Studio takes a lot of space (1.64 GB)</strong><br />
                                After starting Android Studio and launching Android Emulator, more than 90% of physical
                                memory has been used by only these two.
                                That’s why working with Android Studio often took us more time than expected.</p>

                        <p>Apart from technical difficulties we faced some challenges caused by the team itself.</p>

                                    A team achieves more when all of the members are fully engaged and interested in the
                                    outcome. Sometimes,
                                    it is hard to bring all the members under the same roof. At first, designating weekly meeting slots was a bit challenging, as we did not have a common timetable.
                                    Distinguishing the range of abilities of each colleague and appointing errands as
                                    needed was also challenging.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p><strong>Task management</strong> <br />
                                    As few of our colleagues had some thought regarding programming advancement even
                                    before the begin, the undertaking
                                    of the rest was not so challenging.
                                    Isolating undertakings in every milestone and appointing to colleagues made work
                                    adjusted. Everybody left a mark in each progression of this android application.
                                    Lastly, in light of the profitable direction from our customer/instructor, we could
                                    finish every one of our assignments on time.

                        <p>When it comes to maximizing the effectiveness of a project, no matter how big or small,
                            teamwork can improve just about every aspect of its performance.</p>

                                    When a team works well together as a unit, they are able to accomplish more than its
                                    individual members can do alone.
                                    Every member applied different skills, so we were able to come up with a more
                                    effective solution.

                                </p>

                                    Mutual support can have the benefit of encouraging people to achieve goals they may
                                    not have realized they could reach on their own. Information is shared among the
                                    team members, maximizing the levels of knowledge and learning. The stronger team
                                    members effectively improve the weaker.

                                    Everyone can gain knowledge and ideas from each other. After completing this project,
                                    we can ensure that now we know tons of new things/techniques that were unknown to us before this project.
                                    Whenever some team members were stuck in some point, others tried their best to pull him up
                                    by sharing their ideas. So by this process, all of us has gathered 
                                    tremendous knowledge about many things. We hope, this will help a lot in our future work.

                                android app and learning some project management skills. It was a more effective learning
                                approach, due to practical application of the lecture contents. It has helped us in
