Note that you can easily use Markdown to author your posts. This should make your life much more easier---Wooohooo!

One more word about markdown: Is is a really easy-to-learn markup language, similar to those used in Wikis.
Here is a link to all important command on one page: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf).

Additionally, there is a great web page with lots of examples for using Markdown, including how to integrate images, videos etc.
Here is the link: [Markdown reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Just as a brief example since I think you will need that quite often: Below you can find an image with a relative reference to its path.



You can even add an image inline  which means that it will appear within the text, directly at the place where you located the link. And, it is even resized ;)
