								<p>Welcome to the blog of team <b>The Clever Swabian</b>!
									We are a team of four students who are excited to show you the progress of our project. We are going to build our first Android application.
									On these pages you can follow our way to accomplish our goal.</p>
								
								<u><h2 id="team">The team</h2></u>

								<h3 id="naseeb"><b>Md Shohanoor Rahman</b></h3>
								<img class="center" src="images\1.jpg" alt="images\Building an Application" title="images\Building an Application" />
								<ul>
								<h4> Electrical &amp; electronic engineer from Bangladesh, has knowledge in coding in C++ and Java.
									Can work with a strong motivation as a team member and manage the team tasks.</h4>
								</ul>
								
								<h3 id="Philipp"><b>Philipp Gnoyke</b></h3>

								<h4>Mechanical engineer from Germany, has been learning Java and conducting game modding for quite some time now and likes to learn the process of developing an Android app by working as part of a team for this project.</h4>
								</ul>
								
								<h3 id="Muhib"><b>Mohammad Mohaiminul Muhib</b></h3>
								<img class="center" src="images\3.jpg" alt="images\Building an Application" title="images\Building an Application" />
								
								<ul>
								  <h4>Computer science engineer from Bangladesh, eager to learn new technologies and work as a valuable team member.</h4>
								</ul>
								
								<h3 id="Shaiful Islam"><b>Md Shaiful Islam</b></h3>
								<img class="center" src="images\4.jpg" alt="images\Building an Application" title="images\Building an Application" />
								
								<ul>
								  <h4>Mechanical engineer from Bangladesh, good at adopting new skills and moderating team meetings.
									Motivated to dive into the world of software engineering.</h4>
								</ul>
								
								<p>Our team is an outstanding combination of supportive skills. Shaiful, Naseeb and Muhib have already completed their first semester of the study course Digital Engineering and therefore have knowledge of coding in Java and basic software development.
									Being graduated engineers, all of us value the relevance of time management. Furthermore, meeting deadlines is considered crucial. We will be supporting each other to successfully reach our goal.</p>
								
								<u><h2 id="project">Our app</h2></u>
								
								<p><span class="center">

								<p>The app "The clever Swabian" will allow users to keep track of their daily financial transactions.
									Thus, it helps to keep a positive balance and identify unnecessary spending while not requiring big documentation efforts.</p>
								
								<p>You may ask yourself, what our name stands for.
									A common stereotype among Germans is that the people from the southwestern German region Swabia are rather frugal.
									This means that they prefer saving money instead of spending it wherever it is possible.
									If you are a clever steoretypical Swabian, you might not want to abolish this trait of yours but rather bring it to the digital age for which we are delivering the appropriate tools.</p>	
									
									
									<u><h2 id="project">Motivation behind our App</h2></u>
								
								<p><span class="center">
								
								<p>It is often necessary for us to keep our budget in check in every month. As humans no one is above temptations so often it is 
									difficult to track down on which purpose we have spent after the month is over. So this is an app which will help us to organize our spending and savings.
									In this way it will keep us focused on our monthly money goals. Being student means we always  have limited financial resources so we wanted to built an app which will be 
									helpful in our real life and make an impact in our practical life, that's another we have chosen this app as our project. </p>
								
									
								<u><h2 id="communication-within-the-team">Communication within the team</h2></u>
								<p>Weekly meetings will be held during the designated periods.
									Furthermore, if problems arise and need to be discussed face-to-face, we will agree on a flexible meeting time and do our best to solve them!
									For all kinds of organisational purposes, we have established a group chat.
									In this way, every participant is always up-to-date about the state of the project. Also, everyone can express their ideas on improvements and changes.
								We intend to use <em>Messenger</em> to exchange ideas, <em>G-Drive</em> to share files and <em>TeamViewer</em> to control remote machines and make the best use of technological tools available.</p>

								</span></p>
								
								<u><h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2></u>
								<p>In the upcoming first sprint of our project, tasks like the exact analysis of the app's user requirements, creating a first mock-up of the logical design and eventually coding a working first prototype have to be focused on.
									As all of us intend to learn as much software engineering related content as possible, each team member will get his hands dirty on most tasks over the project's timespan.
									However, in order to work as efficiently as possible in the first weeks, we have assigned primary responsibilities for the first sprint (which doesn't mean that the others won't contribute to these fields).
									We agreed on these responsibilities:</p>
									
								<ul>
								<li>Muhib: Requirement analysis and logic system design</li>
								<li>Shaiful: Basis UI design and layout</li>	
								<li>Shohanoor: Initial implementation</li>
								<li>Philipp: Quality assurance of the mentioned fields</li>		
								</ul>	
									
								
								<u><h2 id="reacting-to-changing-circumstances">Reacting to changing circumstances</h2></u>
								<p><em>Scrum</em> is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering the highest business value in the shortest time.
									As described, by keeping up a vital communication, we will be able to react to constant changes in the best way possible&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;especially in the agile way of Scrum.</p>

								<p>With the help of the online tool <em>GitHub</em> we will be able to track the project and every team member will be updated by having access to the most recent files.</p>
								
								<p><span class="center">

								<u><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2></u>
								<p>We are confident that the foundation for a successful project has been laid out and we are ready to start building our app. For the next step, we are eager to meet with our customer <em>(Dr. Sandro Schulze)</em> to discuss the detailed requirements.
								Stay tuned for our next blogs about the progress of <strong>The Clever Swabian</strong>!</p>
